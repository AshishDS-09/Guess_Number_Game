# 🎯 Number Guessing Game with Flask

Hey! I made this **Number Guessing Game** 🎮 using **Python** and **Flask** 🌐.  
The game randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and your job is to guess it.  
It tells you if your guess is too high ⬆️, too low ⬇️, or correct 🎉. It also counts how many attempts you took.

I made this project to practice **Python 🐍, Flask 🌐, sessions, and basic web development**. It was really fun to build! 🚀
